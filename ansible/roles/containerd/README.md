# Ansible Tasks for Installing and Configuring `containerd`

This Ansible role is designed to automate the installation and configuration of `containerd` on systems with the DNF package manager (such as Fedora, CentOS 8, etc.). In addition to installing `containerd`, it configures dedicated storage for it.

## Overview

1. **Installing `containerd`**: The specified version of `containerd` is installed via the DNF package manager.
2. **Configuring Dedicated Storage**: If `containerd_disk` and `containerd_disk_fs` variables are defined, the tasks will:
   - Check and possibly create a mount point at `/var/lib/containerd`.
   - Format the specified disk with the desired filesystem.
   - Mount the disk to `/var/lib/containerd`.
   - Add the mount configuration to `/etc/fstab` to ensure persistence across reboots.
   - Restart `containerd` service to reflect the changes.
3. **Enable `containerd` Service**: Ensures that the `containerd` service is enabled to start during system boot.

## Requirements

- Target system(s) should use DNF as the package manager.
- Ansible modules: `dnf`, `stat`, `file`, `community.general.filesystem`, `ansible.posix.mount`, `lineinfile`, and `systemd`.
  - Ensure the `community.general` collection is installed: `ansible-galaxy collection install community.general`.
- `containerd` and its related components should be available in the system's repositories.
- Ensure variables like `containerd_version`, `containerd_disk`, and `containerd_disk_fs` are either defined in your playbook or provided at runtime.

## Variables

- `containerd_version`: The version of `containerd` you want to install.
- `containerd_disk`: The disk that should be dedicated to `containerd`. Example: `/dev/vdb`
- `containerd_disk_fs`: The type of filesystem to format the disk with. Example: `xfs`

## Warnings

- The tasks that format disks can be destructive. Always ensure you have backups and have validated the value of `containerd_disk` to avoid accidental data loss. Consider adding a safety check or prompt for user confirmation before executing the task.
